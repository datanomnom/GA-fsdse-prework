## GreyAtom's Philosophy on Learning
### Learning is for everyone.
    *We've all got plenty of neuroplasticity left in us! No matter your background, you can learn what you want to learn. Believe that you can, and believe that those around you can too.

### Learning is a consequence of thinking.
    *Reading is one way of getting you to think about things that you wouldn't otherwise. Writing encourages thinking. Discussion encourages thinking. Being *active* encourages thinking. Do things! Try things! Think about things!
### We are all students. We are all teachers.
    *There's so much to know! We all learn from one another. Embrace opportunities to learn from others, and opportunities to share what you know.
### Communicate early and often.
    *We want to know what you're thinking!
